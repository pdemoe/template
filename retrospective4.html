			<p>these may seem as though they wouldn’t affect the video very much but they can, in fact, alter the whole presentation. Making sure the small details correspond with the overall message of the video is very important for the audience to understand it fully. Besides the video portion though, there is a short written requirement for this project. The written portion is a short memo that is about 1500 words and goes along with the video. You discuss a lot about the process of planning the video and how you went about doing the project. This memo is not very difficult because for the most part it is simply stating everything you did while creating the video and how your group worked together. The multi modal remix project is overall a very interesting project to do and a good way to learn more about communication via film as opposed to writing, but it does require work and shouldn’t be looked at as a project that can be put off until the end because it is definitely not. </p>
			<p>Overall, WRA 110, although WRA classes are required, is a very worthwhile course to take and helped to develop my writing skills through the completion of a variety of different assignments and projects. All of the papers that were written helped to build on different writing styles throughout the semester and being able to write about a lot of things that were interesting to me made the class even more enjoyable. I have definitely become a better writer and built writing skills that will be used throughout my college career and even in the rest of life. The thing that made this class special, however, was the technology half of it that required we learn how to write html and CSS and maintain our own personal website with all of our assignments and a weekly blog on it. This was especially helpful for me as I am a marketing major and html and CSS are something that are very useful but I would not have learned them had I enrolled in a different WRA course. I would say that this course has been one of the courses that I feel will have provided me with very useful information that will continue to help with multiple other classes that I am and will be enrolled in while here at Michigan State University, and was a very valuable course to take. </p>
