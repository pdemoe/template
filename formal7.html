Some of the most important of these things that may be overlooked every now and then are research, communication, and technology.

The research part of marketing is very important because if a business doesn’t know anything about their target market then there’s almost no use trying to market something to them.

And finally, technology plays many different roles in marketing, some more apparent than others, that are all vital to a businesses marketing efforts. These roles ranging from using technology to broadcast a commercial or post on social media, to using cookies to track information and store it in a database so as to learn more about customers and market to their specific needs. Among the many comonents that make up marketing and all of the things involved with it, research, communication, and technology all play very important roles when it comes to marketing.</p>
