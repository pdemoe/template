		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p> Writing is one of those classes that someone usually loves because they have a passion for writing, or a class they may not care much for because it’s simply a requirement and seen as a hassle that they just need to get over with. However, just because someone doesn’t necessarily love writing doesn’t mean it can’t be a great class. First year writing classes are one of these classes that I found to be like this. This doesn’t mean that the class doesn’t require any work, trust me it does, but the many different types of papers and assignments that we completed during the course of the class helped a lot to build and develop my writing skills. Outside of just writing, the class also focused on science and technology. Because of this we got to learn some very useful things that an average writing class probably wouldn’t learn. We learned how to write code in html and CSS and then using that information we got to build our very own website, with all of our assignments on it, to turn in at the end of the semester. This was especially helpful for me as I have a major in marketing so the class is a very good idea to take if you are majoring in any business or technological career. The projects that we did were the lived experiences project, cultural analysis, formal research project, and the multimodal remix project. We explored many different types of writing during the course of the semester that will be helpful in many ways in the future of my college career and the rest of my life.  </p>
		<p>Beginning with the Lived Experiences Project, I found this specific project to be very helpful in developing my writing skills because it was a personal narrative and many students don’t have as much practice writing personal narratives so this project really helped to expand my understanding on personal narratives. However that also made the project more difficult because it was tricky to break the habit of writing a formal paper and try to make it more informal like a narrative. In this project we had to choose a piece of technology and explain how that has affected our lives and choice in major. This was really cool because we got to explore something that really interests you. It also required little to no  </p>
