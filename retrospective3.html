			<p>word counts. It really isn’t too bad as long as you spread out the work over the few weeks’ time you have to do it.  Another thing that is important for the research project is that all sources used are credible ones, and that all sources are cited properly. If your sources aren’t cited then you can be charged with plagiarism and then the paper will be all for nothing, so citing is very important. Making sure the pictures and graphs that are used are helpful is also something to watch out for. Don’t just throw any picture into your project for the sake of having it. Pictures can add a lot to the paper if they are used properly and with the right information. The final thing that I would say is important for the formal research paper is to make sure the examples and information in the paper are specific. Having general statements won’t be very effective so making sure examples provide specific details is vital for this paper.  Overall it does require a lot of work but as long as time is used efficiently and you plan out the paper it isn’t too overwhelming. </p>

This also requires a fair amount of work when it comes to filming and editing the video but is a cool way to take a break from writing regular papers but still explore different types of communication. Similar to the research project it isn’t that bad as long as you space out your work and don’t wait until the last minute. While filming the project does take up some time, editing the footage can be very tedious and should definitely not be left until the last minute because it will be very difficult to finish on time. For this project you’re required to interview different people or perform an experiment, and research more about whichever topic it is that is chosen and compile it all into a video.  It is nice because you have a lot of control over the information being presented and how the video is produced. There is the main set of requirements but otherwise you have a lot of freedom on how to make the video and what it is about. Some important things to keep in mind while making the video though, are things such as the color scheme, font-styles, and background music. Small aspect such as </p>
