		<h1>Modern Family: The Debate Against Same-Sex Marriage-Page 3</h1>
			<p>This is a very big thing for the same-sex marriage debate because there are so many people out there who are against it, it becomes hard to have prominent gay characters in the media. Many of the arguments that are against gay marriage are very personal reasons though, which makes them very strong and important to the people who hold them. Some of these arguments include that same-sex marriage goes against many religions, which is true in many cases. There is also the argument that Same-sex couples are bad for society because they can’t produce children or that marriage is meant for only man and woman and by allowing same-sex couples to get married it is destroying the sacredness of marriage. On the other hand though, there are many arguments that support same-sex marriage. One of the main supporting reasons is that, the United States was founded on the principle of freedom and that everyone should have equal rights, so that should apply to same-sex marriage as well. Also, allowing same-sex marriage could actually bring in more money for the government because of higher taxes for married couples and marriage licenses. So there are strong arguments on both sides of the debate, but with the help of the media, there is slowly becoming an increase in people who support gay marriage. </p>
		<p>Personally, I support the right for same-sex couple to get married for many different reasons. To begin, there are many arguments supporting same-sex marriage that cancel out the arguments against it. People who believe same-sex marriage is against their religion do have a valid point for why they perhaps don’t want to, or shouldn’t, be in a same-sex relationship, but the thing about that is, it only applies to the people who are practicing that religion, not everybody in the world. If other people want to be in same sex relationships, it doesn’t affect those who disagree in any way, so their religion should not be a concern to anyone else. Along with that, we are supposed to have separation of church and state so any religious reasons really  </p>
