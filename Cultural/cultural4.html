		<h1>Modern Family:The Debate Against Same-Sex Marriage-Page 4</h1>
			<p>should not affect the laws made about same-sex marriage by the government. Also, the belief that same-sex marriage is bad because they cannot reproduce, while factually this is true, this doesn’t make same-sex couples bad for society. In fact, this can even been seen as a good thing for society. There are many children that are homeless or in orphanages and same-sex couples are very often the people who adopt those kids and give them a good home. Also, if that were to be held as a legitimate reason to ban gay marriage then, logically, infertile people should also not be allowed to get married. Which really shows how foolish of an argument it is. There is also the thought that allowing gay marriage tarnishes the reputation of marriage, but in this day and age marriage has become less and less important, especially with the upcoming generation. Many people don’t view marriage as such an important thing anymore, especially with many celebrities getting married and the divorced almost immediately, it is hard to say that marriage is thought of in the same way as it used to be. Lastly, many people who are against gay marriage just because it “makes them uncomfortable” seem to be under the impression that by not allowing same-sex marriage, it will banish all gay couples but many same-sex couples are already living together and functioning as a married couple in every way except on a legal level. So allowing gay marriage would barely even have an effect on how people go about their daily lives.  </p>

With the media being the biggest influence on the younger generations nowadays it could really help to improve the overall view on same-sex marriage. Especially because a few states have legalized gay marriage, all that is needed is a small push to improve people’s opinions and hopefully legalize it in other states. Shows like Modern Family specifically are very good for the public opinion on gay couples because it does not focus solely on the gay couple or on the fact that they are gay. It </p>
