		<h1>Modern Family: The Debate Against Same-Sex Marriage</h1>
			<p>“With liberty and justice for all.” Sounds familiar doesn’t it? That’s because this is a part of our pledge of allegiance. A part of something that we as Americans promise to each other, yet somehow there are still people out there who don’t experience the same liberty and justice as everyone else. These people are the members of the gay community and although they are really no different than anyone else, they are treated with less respect. In this day and age, however, much of the younger generations are heavily influenced by popular media such as TV shows like the popular comedy show Modern Family. This show features two main characters that are in an openly gay relationship that have an adopted Vietnamese daughter. Shows like this can have a huge impact on the viewers and it is a good thing that there are such shows because of the limited rights that same-sex couples currently have. Same-sex couples should have the same rights as everyone else in this country so by promoting and increasing shows with openly gay characters that are portrayed in a positive light, hopefully the public opinion on gay marriage will improve and it will soon become 100% legalized.</p>

Once they find true love they aren’t allowed to have the simple pleasure of being happy and marrying the person they want to be with for the rest of their life. They are suddenly not worthy of marriage or become viewed as lesser to society, and all of this is only because some other people, who may not even know them, have decided that they’re not comfortable with these people getting married and that they shouldn’t be allowed to have the happy ending that they want. These people are subject to what is essentially just bullying simply because their lifestyle doesn’t fit what everybody’s ideal lifestyle is, and it’s time that this ends. This issue is the debate on same-sex marriage, which has become an increasingly popular topic in society today and even more so in the media. Many shows nowadays, such as the show Modern Family, feature gay couples and this can have a huge impact on the same-sex marriage issue. In fact, there was a study conducted by Ipsos MediaCT that showed that about 18% of people aged 13-64 that watch TV say that television in general has changed their opinion of same-sex marriage in a positive way. </p>
		<p> Modern Family is one of the shows that help improve the view of same-sex couples and is a popular comedy television show right now that focuses on the lives of three modern families. Among these three families is what people would consider to be a typical American family, consisting of a mother and father with three kids. There is also an older man and his younger trophy wife who have a son, and, the couple that will be the most important, a gay couple with an </p>
