			<p>research because it was just about personal experiences. The only tricky thing was making sure it was, in fact, that it was structured like a narrative and making sure that it isn’t too formal. Also because this project was one of the projects that doesn’t require much research it makes it one of the easier papers that were written but just because you don’t need much research doesn’t mean it is a paper that can be completely made up last minute. Like all of the papers for this class, it is difficult to try to do last minute instead of planning it out. Overall though, the lived experiences project is one of the more laid back and enjoyable papers that are assigned because it is about something that you are hopefully very interested in.</p>
		<p>The next paper we had was the Cultural Analysis project. For this assignment we had to choose another piece of technology and a popular social issue and then explain how they were related and influenced each other. Picking a social issue that interests you and has a lot of information will make this project a lot better because you will actually get to spend time writing about something that is relevant to you and not just something you don’t care about. This will also help the quality of your paper improve. Because this one was a more formal project I found that it was easier to write but did require more research. Making sure you have the right background information on the issue and technology you choose is very important to make sure the paper is effective. As long as the right amount of research is done on the different parts of this project it really wasn’t too bad because again you get to choose a social issue and piece of technology so that makes it a lot more interesting. However, the length of the paper is a little bit longer than the lived experiences so it does require a little more planning.  </p>
		<p>The formal research was a bit more work than the others, not only because it was longer but it required more in-depth research and other tasks like interviews. It is, however, about your own major so again it is hopefully still an interesting topic to be researching. The key for the research paper is to not wait until the last minute to do it because it does require a lot of work and has one of the longer  </p>
