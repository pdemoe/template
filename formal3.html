				<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Marketing is the aspect of the business world that is involved with the spreading of information about a certain product or service. This can be business to business marketing, in which companies sell products to other companies that need them, such as a steel company selling steel to a car company that will use it to build cars. Or there is business to consumer marketing, which is businesses that sell their products directly to their customers, such as a clothing store or grocery store. Marketing can also range from telling a neighbor about a cool product, or a business that broadcasts commercial all the way across the globe. The thing that makes marketing so interesting, however, is that it has two different sides that combine to create the whole of marketing. The first half of marketing is the side that is mostly advertising and spreading news about a product. Whereas the second half is the research-oriented half. In the research side of marketing businesses go through market researching to find out information about what is called the target market, or the ideal customers for a business, so that they can better their products and advertisements to appeal to those individuals. The whole of marketing however, or the marketing mix, is made up of four main components that business use to have the most effective marketing process that they can.

As the diagram on the right shows, a business must assess these four things to come out with the most effective marketing strategy for that business’s target market. </p>
