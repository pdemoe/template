			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Imagine making an amazing product, one of the best products around, and it seems like it should sell out in a heartbeat, but nobody has heard of it, so after it has been produced nobody buys it. Then there ends up being boxes and boxes of this product sitting around. Well, the solution to that problem is marketing. Marketing is one of the most important components of any business, because what use is a product if nobody knows about it? Marketing is the part of business that deals with getting a business’ message out there. It has two different side though, there’s the research half, which deals primarily with researching the products and target market, and the advertising half, which is the part that is responsible for getting a product or message out there. Research is important in marketing because without researching a target market, a company would have no idea how to market their product and, in turn, would not sell enough of that product. So, once a company has researched their target market, they have to deal with how to market their product. One of the most popular ways of communication in marketing today is through technology like social media, which is very important to marketing as well. Social media is a very common use of marketing because of how convenient it is. With just the click of a button or two, a message can be published and seen all across the world through social media. Social media and technology are also popular because of how easy it is to get a message out all across the world. However, these are just some of the main parts of marketing. Marketing is one of the most extensive areas in business that can range from putting up posters, to showing a commercial all across the world.</p>
