		<h1 style="color: purple">My Most Important Decision</h1>
			<p> “Paige will you please put your phone down and listen to me!” is all I ever remember my mom saying to me ever since I got a smart phone, but she did have a good reason for it! I will admit I was always on my phone checking all of my social media sites like twitter or Instagram and if I wasn’t on my phone then I was on the computer doing the exact same thing. So I guess deep down I always sort of had a passion for communicating with other people, and social media just so happened to become popular at the perfect time for me because it’s exactly what helped me to decide on my major.</p>
			<p>I would spend hours and hours worrying about what I should major in and the entire time I would be using social media to complain about it or learn about different majors without even realizing I was secretly helping myself decide. Now, it’s not like I just woke up one day and had a magical “eureka” moment where I suddenly discovered that I wanted to major in marketing, but it did sort of hit me as an obvious choice once I realized it. For the longest time I really only came up with things I didn’t want to do or didn’t like but once I started thinking of stuff that interested me, I realized that they were basically the components of marketing. </p>
			<p>Now just to explain it a bit more, marketing is the part of business that deals with promoting and selling different items or services, and there’s two sides of marketing: the research side and the advertising side. The side that I’m a lot more interested in is mostly the advertising side because when I was a kid I was always amazed with computers and things like social media and how I could still talk to my friend that moved to another country even though she was thousands of miles away. I could have cared less about how the computer magically sent my message through the computer though, I was just amazed that it even could. Which is probably why social media is quickly becoming very important all across the world, and not just for teenagers posting pictures of their Starbucks drink! Nobody ever really thinks about it but social media is almost like magic. I mean it can connect people from all the way across the globe and get your message out to more people than you ever imagined, now how many people can say they can do that themselves? Probably nobody, and that’s exactly why I love it, especially since I have friends that live in a lot of different countries than me like Canada, and even Germany, and even though they live halfway across the globe, through social media, I can wake up in the middle of the night and decide I miss them and all I have to do is go on Twitter or Facebook and I can send them a message in seconds. So because of all that, I think that marketing is the right path for me. </p>
		<p>Over the summer I interned at a computer company called Atrio Systems, and my job there was to run a YouTube channel for the company and, while I was spending so much time around social media before, I really noticed how much social media can affect people during the internship. In the beginning of the internship I really wasn’t very excited because, honestly, I was forced into doing it in the first place and who would be excited about waking up at 7 am and sitting in an office for 8 or more hours every day? Not me, that’s for sure. I pretty much thought that I would just be have to do boring, simple, tasks but it ended up being much more than that. Each day, after dragging myself out of bed and managing to put on some nice clothes, I would go into the office and I would have to come up with a new demo idea to make a YouTube video about and then go through the process of filming, editing, and publishing each video. Eventually it just became routine for me to be making videos and I didn’t think much of it but it really hit me when I saw that people from all over were watching the videos I had made, and I realized that with social media and marketing combined, I could really make a difference and communicate with people all across the world. </p>
	<p> I’ve also been in love with music my whole life and to be more specific about my career, I want to go into marketing in the music industry. So as you may have guessed, the creation of the iPod really changed my life, even though I never really realized it until now. All of my life I’ve had some sort of musical device, from a boom box to a portable CD player, to an IPod. But when I was younger never imagined that they would make something like an IPod that can do so much with music other than just playing it out loud for me to enjoy.</p>
		<p>I remember laying on my bed in my room and being in a bad mood and reaching over to my nightstand, grabbing my IPod and turning on my favorite song and after the song was over I was in a much better mood than I was just minutes ago, or I would be blasting a song throughout the house when nobody was home and dancing through the house, having a great time. And it’s just amazing that something that’s really just a sound wave can do that, when people can barely do it. My IPod comes in to it because it’s what made it possible for me to bring music with me to school and work and friends’ houses, or anywhere else I went, and when I click the on button I suddenly have the option to listen to whatever I want, whenever I want. It’s also amazing how music can connect people all across the world, in a similar way to social media, because IPods have made music so portable, anybody anywhere in the world could be listening to the same song as I am the exact same time as me. But it’s not only that part of music that brings people together. I remember being at a concert, I could feel the bass in my chest, and see thousands of strangers around me, but at the same time, I knew that all of those strangers were at that concert for the same reason: the music. I looked around and saw all of those people singing along to the same song as me, and having a great time and it felt like we were somehow connected through the songs. Even though I didn’t know any of their names and they didn’t know anything about me, other than the fact that we probably like the same music, everything was alright, even though it was just for a few hours. But then days, and weeks, even months and years after that concert, or any concert for that matter, I would meet people everywhere I went who would tell me they were at the very same concert and I would think how crazy it is that, at some point in time, I may have been just inches away from that person and not even noticed it but here they are again and now I already have a connection with them.</p>
		<p> All of my life I have been interested in music, and I remember going to my first concert when I was in fifth grade and about 30 more since then, I’ve probably spent over $1400 on concert tickets and related things, and I really do have a special place in my heart for music. So when I was about 10 I got my first IPod for Christmas, a black, first-edition IPod Nano, I was obviously very excited about it and immediately went to the computer to put my favorite songs on it and, since it was so small and portable, for at least a week straight after getting it there was almost never a moment that I didn’t have headphones in. Even now, my IPod is probably one of my most important possessions to me. So it was mostly thanks to that IPod Nano that I have such a strong interest in music to this day. </p>
		<p>As I have grown up since then, I never lost that love for music and, while there was a while when I didn’t really know what I wanted to do with my life, I knew that somehow I wanted music to be involved.  The only problem with that was that, aside from playing a bit of guitar, I never really had very many musical talents, but that is what helped me realize that I want to work in the behind-the-scenes part of the music industry that people don’t always think about when they think of music, and marketing just so happened to be the perfect fit.</p>
		<p>So, because of the influence of those pieces of technology, I chose to hopefully go into marketing in the music industry and I really think this will be the perfect job for me because I was always interested in connecting people from all across the world and seeing how certain things, like music or twitter, can bring people together. My iPod and social media also helped me to realize that music and marketing are a perfect combination in my books, and my passion for both music and social media make it all the more interesting. So thanks to things like social media, and the IPod I finally decided on my major and realized that I will be spending every day of the rest of my life doing something that I love.</p>
