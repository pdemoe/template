			<p> 140 characters. That doesn’t really seem like a lot when you think about it but nowadays it’s more than enough for people to talk to each other instantly from all across the world and say whatever it is they’re thinking. But then there’s also being able to upload a picture in seconds and show everyone what your dog did yesterday, what drink you ordered from Starbucks or even what your business is promoting. These things probably seem kind of random but these are some of the things that make up one of the most important pieces of technology for me: social media. </p>
			<p> When I had to decide what I wanted to major in, it was a tough decision. Deciding how I want to spend most of my time, every day, for the rest of my life has definitely been the most important and hardest decision I have ever had to make. I have always been afraid that I would make the wrong choice and end up at a nine to five job sitting at a desk, doing something I really don’t care about. So for a while I really wasn’t sure what I wanted to do but then, because of a couple different pieces of technology, including social media, I realized what I wanted to do. I wanted to major in marketing. Marketing is the part of business that deals with promoting and selling a product, and there’s two sides of marketing: research and advertising. The side that I am interested in is more of the advertising side. When I was child I was always amazed with computers and things like social media and how fast you could talk to people that were hundreds of miles away. I wasn’t very interested in how it worked though, as much as what it could do.  Social media is quickly becoming very important in not just the daily lives of teenagers and students like me, but also in the business world. People never really think about it but social media can do some really amazing things when it comes to marketing. Social media can connect people from all the way across the globe and get your message out to more people than you have ever imagined. I personally think this is very cool because I have friends that live in many different countries than me like Canada, and even Germany, and I think it’s become really important for me to be able to talk to these people and maintain our friendship and its social media that has helped me to do that. So because of this, I have found that marketing is the path for me. </p>
			<p>Another one of the major experiences I have had with this technology is over the summer, I interned at a computer company called Atrio Systems, and ran a YouTube channel for the company. During this internship I realized how much social media can affect people. In the beginning of the internship I really wasn’t very excited because, honestly, I was forced into doing it in the first place and I imagined that I would just be doing boring, simple, tasks but it ended up being much more than that. Each day I would go into the office and I would have to come up with a new topic to make a YouTube video about and then go through the process of filming, editing, and publishing each video. As I did this, I became very aware of how amazing technology can be. It really hit me when I saw that people from all over were watching the videos I had made, and I realized that with social media and marketing combined, I could really make a difference and communicate with people all across the world. </p>
			<p>Besides social media, there has been other technology that has influenced my choice in my career. To be more specific, I want to go into Marketing in the music industry. One of the main pieces of technology that has influenced that choice is, as you may have guessed, the IPod. All of my life I’ve had some sort of musical device, from a boom box to a portable CD player, to an IPod. When I was younger I would have never imagined that they would make something like an IPod that can do so much with music other than just playing it and now that they have it has influenced me and my choices in life quite a bit. Although it is less the physical IPod that influenced me and more of what it is that the IPod makes possible for me to do.</p>
			<p>Music is the soundtrack to our lives and it can do so much more for you than it may seem, and that is one of the reasons I have chosen to go into marketing in the music industry.  Music can help people through tough times, cheer them up when they are in a bad mood, or even just give them something to dance to when they are bored. Sometimes, some songs can even bring down their mood, and to me it is amazing that something that is essentially just a sound wave can do these sorts of things, when people struggle to do these tasks every day. The IPod comes in to this because it’s what makes it possible for me to bring music with me anywhere I go, and lets me listen to whatever I want, whenever I want to listen to it. I also find it amazing how music can connect people all across the world, in a similar way to social media, because IPods have made music so portable, anybody anywhere in the world can be listening to the same song as I am the very same moment as me. It’s not only that aspect of music that bring people together though. One of my favorite things about music is that I can be at a concert with thousands of strangers around me, but know all of those strangers are at that concert for the same reason: the music. And when I look around and see all of those people singing along to the same song as me, and having a great time, it seems like we’re all connected. Even though I may not even know any of their names and they don’t know anything about me, other than the fact that we probably like the same music, everything is alright no matter what someone’s background is, even if it’s just for a few hours.</p>
		<p> This relates to me personally because all of my life I have been interested in music, having gone to my first concert when I was in fifth grade and about 30 more since then, I’ve probably spent over $1400 on concert tickets and related things, and I really do have a special place in my heart for music. So when I was about 10 I got my first IPod for Christmas, a black, first-edition IPod Nano, I was naturally very excited about it and immediately went to the computer to put my favorite songs on it and, since it was so small and portable, for at least a week straight after getting it I don’t think there was ever a moment that I didn’t have headphones in. Even now, my IPod is probably one of my most important possessions to me. So it was mostly thanks to that IPod Nano that I have such a strong interest in music to this day. </p>

		<p>As I have grown up since then, I have never lost that love for music and, while there was a while when I didn’t really know what I wanted to do with my life, I knew that somehow I wanted music to be involved.  The only problem with that was that, aside from playing a bit of guitar, I have never really had very many musical talents, but that is what helped me realize that I want to work in the behind-the-scenes part of the music industry that people don’t always think about when they think of music and marketing just so happened to be the perfect fit.</p>
		<p>So, because of the influence of these pieces of technology, I have been lead to a career path in marketing in the music industry and I really think this will be the perfect job for me because I am very interested in connecting people from all across the world and seeing how certain things, like music or twitter, can bring people together in such a simple way. These pieces of technology have also helped me to realize that, because marketing it is all about getting your message out there, the way the music industry brings people together makes music and marketing a perfect combination in my books and my passion for both music and social media make it all the more interesting. So thanks to things like social media, and the IPod I now know that I will be spending every day of the rest of my life doing something that I love.</p>
