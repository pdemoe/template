			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Research comes into this because, to effectively analyze these components, a business must research their target market so as to be able to set each of these components at the ideal level to increase sales. In an interview Brian Demoe, a former business professor at Oakland University, said that one of the main reasons research is so important to marketing is because “in order to make the most money, you need to know how and where to spend yours.” Meaning that businesses need market research because that can help them to have better asset allocation, or knowing what to spend money on in order to market their product. He also said a very important aspect of marketing research is knowing what products a market needs. For example, if there is already five shoe retailers in one mall, it would be foolish to try to start another shoe business in that same mall because no more that particular product is not needed. As stated in “The BASIC marketing planning process: a practical framework for the smaller business” by Roger Brooksbank, some of the most important things to look into when conducting market research are market size and trends, customer needs and wants, customer satisfaction levels, competitor activity, and competitor performance.  This research can be carried out through a few different methods which fall under the categories of quantitative or qualitative research. Quantitative research is used for gathering a lot of information but often in close proximity, while qualitative research is usually more intensive but on a smaller sample, such as a small group of people being asked their opinions on a product. The majority of market resarch falls under the quantitative category with methods such as desk research and field research, which does, however, have a few methods that would fall under the quantitative category. First, the focus will be on the quantitative research though. Desk research is more of a secondary type of research that involves looking at a company’s records, government publications,etc. to find information regarding things such as sales and production. While Field research is much more interactive with customers and can be divided into a few different methods. These can be split into surveys or questionairres, which are both very easy to administer and are quick and easy ways to botain information. They can be done through phone, in person, or on a handout and usually consist of a few short questions for the customer to respond to. The other approaches, which are more qualitative,  are and telephone or personal interviews. These are also moderately easy to perform but tend to have a lower yeild of responses because people often do not want to spend the time doing an interview. These methods do still provide very accurate and importnant information to businesses though.  There is one final form of research that some businesses may use to further the research they have already done, or test it out. This is commonly refered to as a test market, in which a company may release a product in a small, controlled area, such as a city or town, and they monitor how their target market reacts to the product and gather more data in relation to their target market, sales, and production. This can help a business a lot if they have already done some research and want to ensure that their product won’t fail on a larger scale. </p>
