	<h1> Video Analysis </h1>
		<ul>
			<li> Purpose of the video:
				<p>I think the purpose of this video was for the author to express his feelings about his uncles death and being gay. I also this he was using it as a way to cope with such a traumatic event, and give hope to others out there that may be in the same sort of situation as him and show people that there's always another choice and that things will get better.</p> </li>
			<li> How the video attempts achieve it's purpose:
				<p>This video attempts to achieve its purpose, I think mainly by being so personal and emotional. You can hear in his voice how important this issue is to him and It helps viewers to relate to it even if they haven’t experienced a similar situation because you can feel the emotion in it and you feel sympathy for him. Also I think because of the emotion in it helps to inspire other people in the same way and help give them inspiration. </p>
			<li> Structure of the message:
				<p> The structure of this message was mainly a personal letter that he wrote to his dead unlce who experienced a similar situation to what he was experiencing at the time, but he made it more personal by reading the letter out loud. He probably wanted to make it into a video so that people from all across the country that may share similar stories can relate to him</p> </li>
			<li> How the video's structure can help revise the Lived Experiences Project
				<p> Because this video is so emotional and personal I think it can help me to revise my project into being more personal. This would then make it so that hopefully the readers of my project can connect more with the essay and can really understand where I’m coming from when I talk about the influences on my major and my life.</p></li>

<h1>My First Paper-9/22</h1>
<p>writing my first paper for college was a little bit harder than i expected. Not because the topic or material was hard to write about but because it was a narrative. I've never had to write a narrative before so I found it kind of difficult to do, and I found that I had to keep going over my paper and trying to make it less and less formal and more like a narrative. So overall the first paper was okay but a bit difficult just because it was in the form of a narrative.</p>
<h1> The Social Network & The Correlation between Formal Education and Economic and Personal Success </h1>
<p>I think that, if I were to base this only on The Social Network, then there is still a correlation between formal education and personal success but it shows less of a correlation than what I think might be the real life correlation. In the movie he still does have at least somewhat of a formal education, having gone to high school and attended Harvard for a while before dropping out. But I don’t think he would have been nearly as successful as he was if he hadn’t gone to school before making Facebook. In the movie though he does still become very successful after dropping out of school and makes a ton of money off of Facebook so it does show that you can be very successful without complete formal education. I think however in real life, while that is true in some situations, overall I think a formal education helps you to be more successful.</p>
<h1>Cultural Analysis </h1>
	<p> This cultural analysis paper was a really cool paper for me just because I thought it was cool that we got to analyze something from modern technology. It was kind of slow at first for me and I didn't really know what to write but eventually it became easier as I kept going and overall I think it wasn't too bad. Especially because I got to write about one of my favorite shows! </p>
<h1>Research Paper</h1>
<p>So far this research paper hasn't been that bad, it's probably not going to be as bad I actually thought it would, but we haven't really done much yet so I guess we'll see.</p>
<p> Overall the research paper wasn't too bad, I did have to do a lot of work involving interviews and sources but that is all what would be normally expected in a research paper and the actual writing of it wasn't too bad, especially pertaining to my major. </p>
<h1> Detroit Commercial </h1> 
<p>I think this commercial is very successful because of the different methods they used. The imagery of Detroit helped a lot because it shows the viewers exactly where the cars are coming from and makes them feel more connected to the car and the whole commercial. I also think the voiceover was very important to the effectiveness of the commercial because the man is using the ethos appeal by saying things like "what does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?" but then saying "its the hottest fires that make the hardest steel" it's very convincing and is trying to show that Detroit may have been trough a lot but the one thing they really know how to do well is make cars. One of the last things that really helped make the commercial as effective as it was was having "Lose Yourself" by eminem playing in the background. This was effective not only because Eminem himself was featured in the commercial but because it is a well known song and the meaning the song has that can be related back to Detroit. The song itself is a lot about seizing an opportunity to be successful which is a lot similar to what Detroit has done. Specifically the song says things like "If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted. one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip?" which is could be seen as a refernce to how the motor industry is a lot like Detroits one opportunity that they captured to be successful and didn't just let it pass by. Another line in the song that seems very relevant is "Success is my only motherf*cking option, failure's not." This line is similar to how Detroit has pushed trough everything and come through all of their struggles and come out on top to be known as the motor city and make some of the best cars in the world. </p>
			<h1> Remix Project</hi>
				<p>The remix prject was a really cool project because it was something different than just writing a regular paper. It was interesting to get to take an older paper and look more into it and turn it into something else. It was however a lot of work to edit the videos but as long as you space it out it really wasn't too bad and was a nice break from writing papers.  </p>
