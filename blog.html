			<li> Purpose of the video:
				<p>I think the purpose of this video was for the author to express his feelings about his uncles death and being gay. I also this he was using it as a way to cope with such a traumatic event, and give hope to others out there that may be in the same sort of situation as him and show people that there's always another choice and that things will get better.</p> </li>
			<li> How the video attempts achieve it's purpose:
				<p>This video attempts to achieve its purpose, I think mainly by being so personal and emotional. You can hear in his voice how important this issue is to him and It helps viewers to relate to it even if they haven’t experienced a similar situation because you can feel the emotion in it and you feel sympathy for him. Also I think because of the emotion in it helps to inspire other people in the same way and help give them inspiration. </p>
			<li> Structure of the message:
				<p> The structure of this message was mainly a personal letter that he wrote to his dead unlce who experienced a similar situation to what he was experiencing at the time, but he made it more personal by reading the letter out loud. He probably wanted to make it into a video so that people from all across the country that may share similar stories can relate to him</p> </li>
			<li> How the video's structure can help revise the Lived Experiences Project
				<p> Because this video is so emotional and personal I think it can help me to revise my project into being more personal. This would then make it so that hopefully the readers of my project can connect more with the essay and can really understand where I’m coming from when I talk about the influences on my major and my life.</p></li>
