			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>There is one thing that no business, no matter how big or small, can survive without. They need it to keep their business going through tough times and easy ones. While the obvious answer to this might be money, there is something else that overshadows money. This thing is marketing. Marketing is all around no matter where one looks. It’s the neighbors talking about their cool new blender to their aunt. It’s someone handing out those little surveys when people leave a store. It’s even the guy dressed up as a piece of pizza who’s dancing on the corner. Marketing can range from so many different things, but is mainly involved with research and getting a business’ message out there, and is important to businesses because without marketing, stores wouldn’t get any customers and in turn not make any money. But, there are many things that businesses do to ensure that their marketing strategies are successful. Like marketing in general, these things can range from very small tasks, to much larger scale and more complex actions but some of the main things that are needed are research, marketing for many different reasons. Without research, a business would never know who to market their product to or how to market it. After they do research on their market they then need to know how to communicate with their potential and current customers and technology is very often key when it comes to this communication. Technology can also be used for background work that involves gathering more information about customers so as to become more familiar with them. All of these things combined are what help to maximize the effect of a marketing plan for any business no matter what type of business they are, how small or large of a company they are, or where they’re located.</p>
