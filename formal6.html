			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Along with communication, technology is another one of the very important portions of marketing. Technology is very essential  to marketing for many different reasons, some more obvious than the others. The more obvious reasons being for things such as displaying commercials and promotions. Through the use of the aforementioned technology of television, social media, emails and other things of similar functions, many businesses can interact with their customers in just an instant. Especially because of the incredible developments in technology that have happened recently, a business located in Hong Kong can easily interact with a customer all the way in California without having to pay incredible fees to fly across the ocean to see them. Technology is also very useful because it can help businesses to promote their product or service to a much wider range of people than it was ever possible without it. Because of this, a store can broadcast a commercial to millions of people whereas before techonolgy it would be nearly impossible to accomlish such a feat. One of the less apparent uses for technology in marketing, which is arguably more important than the main content, is the use of databases and background technology. An article titled “Good Marketing All Boils Down To Great Execution” by Laura Mazur explains that what goes on behind the scenes in a business is equally important as what goes on in the front and that to be successful a business must be able to utilize the information they have. So although this type of technology is done a lot more in the background and does not usually get much recognition, it can still be crucial for businesses. The use of a database may seem very simple but through programs such as Microsoft CRM businesses can perform simple but time consuming tasks, such as sending out emails to all customers, in a very short period of time. Cookies, not the delicious dessert but a program that is used to track what websites, recent searches, and other similar things that a particular person may visit,  are often a very common use of technology in marketing. These are very popular because they are used to gather as much information about custimers as possible and can help a business to understand their customers better. As stated by Laura Mazur “you have to understand your most valuable customers to deliver better products faster” so these cookies are important to know customers better.  This information is usually stored in other databases and companies will often buy these databases so they can better their lead generation, selling, customer retention, and customer service. Also to better their marketing and send customers emails or flyers that pertain to the specific things that that customer seems to be interested in, in hopes of having the result be the customer purchasing what they need from that business. So overall, technology is vital to marketing not just for obvious reasons like television commercials and websites but for the use of databases and cookies to get to know current and potential customers better and in turn, gain their customer loyalty.</p>
