		<h1>Modern Family: The Debate Against Same-Sex Marriage-Page 2</h1>
			<p>adopted daughter from Vietnam. This show has been going on for 5 seasons now and the openly gay couple has been a part of it the whole time however they were never married in the show because it is illegal in most states. Throughout the show however, they have had many experiences that shed a positive light on same-sex couples and marriage. For example, in one episode they show their adopted daughter playing with one of her dads and wanting to have a fake wedding with him for fun and the show goes through showing the other dad being jealous that she likes his partner more and they go through a lot of humorous things and have silly fights, the exact same way a lot of heterosexual couples do and it helps show that they really are just like everyone else. Modern Family also makes the two gay characters, Mitchell and Cameron, very likeable people and very relatable to the viewer’s own life and problems so people feel even more connected to them and find them to be much more likeable. Lastly, the show has never had this couple get married to each other because gay marriage has been illegal in all states up until very recently so in the season premier for the fifth season the writers finally had them propose to each other. Now this was a very big step for the show because it’s hard to tell how the audience would react to such a thing but because of the show’s overall positive view on same-sex couples people have reacted very well. In the episode they have Cam and Mitchell trying to outdo each other’s proposals and make it the perfect proposal, in a very relatable way to the average proposal. They go through all of the typical struggles of proposing such as when and where to do it and making sure everything goes smoothly, which it does not, but that is what makes it all the more romantic, and they end up proposing under the stars, just like in a dream. One Antigay blogger even claimed that he was “feeling empathy for same-sex couples” after seeing the proposal episode because it was so moving.  </p>
