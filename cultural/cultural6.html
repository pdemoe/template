		<h1>Modern Family: The Debate Against Same-Sex Marriage-Page 6</h1>
			<p>Modern Family, that do have gay characters, are very important because they help to show that same-sex couples are just like everybody else and that they deserve to have equal rights and opportunities as everybody else, and they deserve to be happy just as much as the next person, and by increasing the amount of shows that feature same-sex couples, hopefully the overall view of them will increase and it will eventually become legal for people to marry the person they love and spend the rest of their lives together, no matter what gender they happen to be. </p>
