			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>After research is complete in marketing,  one of the next most important things is communication and how a business communicates their product or service to other businesses or the public. After all, there is no point in having a product if a business can’t communicate it to anybody. It is also very important that a business can communicate about their product and showcase it exactly how they want to. Marketing has a very vast array of communication techniques but many of the very popular ones today involve things such as television. Television is a very common way for businesses to communicate with prospective and current customers because of the broad amount of people it can reach. But at the same time it is very expensive, due to the costs and efforts it takes to write and produce a commercial, which can deter many smaller companies from using it. Another very common way of communication, especially in this day and age, is social media and the internet. Social media is very quickly becoming one of the main mediums for communication between businesses and their customers because of how cost effective it is and how quickly it works. With just over 55% of adults in America owning smart phones(Rogowski, Forbes.com) and around 37% of teenagers (pewinternet.org), social media seems like almost a no brainer when it comes to communicating with customers. With little to no cost, and the direct communication that social media offers, it isn’t hard to see why it is quickly becoming the leading form of communication in marketing, with over 90% of businesses using it for recruitment and promotional purposes(Beese). Along with social media, websites are very commonly used to communicate information between businesses or customers, again due to the relatively low cost of this, it is another very popular technique. One other form of communication that is slowly declining is the print form, such as flyers or billboards, because of the costs and effort it takes for print communication, it has decreased quite a lot recently and has almost transferred into the online method of communication because the same information can be displayed online and made much more accessible. However, as Laura Cubbler, a marketing manager for Atrio Systems Inc., explained “Print can still be very effective because of the decline in mail and print advertisements, people are much more likely to actually read the mail they do receive.” Finally, the last main form of communication in marketing is one that seems so obvious it is commonly overlooked, and this is the personal aspect of communication such as email, phone calls, text messages, or even personal meetings. These things are very common in every day tasks in the field of marketing and are used because of their quick yield of information, and personal convienience. They can also be used on a more personal level to communicate directly with another person or with a larger group via spam emails, telemarketing, or the slowly emerging method of mass text promotions. All together, these methods make up the main sources of communication in marketing, which is one of the core aspects of marketing and it remains very important no matter what type of marketing is taking place.</p>
